# ProgWithExtensibleUI

A program that has an extensible graphical user interface. The extension of the interface is performed by copying a new assembly to the program directory, which should be automatically loaded at the start of the main program, and its windows should be embedded in the main program window. You need to design the attributes that will be used to mark the dockable windows and their elements. These attributes should control the embedding modes of the window with its elements.
